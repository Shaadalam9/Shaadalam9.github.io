abstract: "Human decision-making errors cause a majority of globally reported marine accidents. As a result, automation in the marine industry has been gaining more attention in recent years. Obstacle avoidance becomes very challenging for an autonomous surface vehicle in an unknown environment. We explore the feasibility of using Deep Q-Learning (DQN), a deep reinforcement learning approach, for controlling an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle to follow a known path while avoiding collisions with static and dynamic obstacles. The ship's motion is described using a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) dynamic model. The KRISO container ship (KCS) is chosen for this study because it is a benchmark hull used in several studies, and its hydrodynamic coefficients are readily available for numerical modelling. This study shows that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve path following and collision avoidance successfully and can be a potential candidate that may be investigated further to achieve human-level or even better decision-making for autonomous marine vehicles."
