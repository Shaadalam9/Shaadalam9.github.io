abstract: "Traffic simulations are crucial for testing systems and human behaviour in transportation research. This study investigates the potential efficacy of Unsupervised Recycle Generative Adversarial Networks (Recycle–GANs) in generating realistic traffic videos by transforming daytime scenes into nighttime environments and vice-versa. By leveraging Unsupervised Recycle-GANs, we bridge the gap between data availability during day and night traffic scenarios, enhancing the robustness and applicability of deep learning algorithms for real - world applications. GPT-4V was provided with two sets of six different frames from each
day and night time from the generated videos and queried whether the scenes were artificially created based on lightning, shadow behaviour, perspective, scale, texture, detail and presence of edge artefacts. The analysis of GPT-4V output did not reveal evidence of artificial manipulation, which supports the credibility and authenticity of the generated scenes. Furthermore, the generated transition videos were evaluated by 15 participants who rated their realism on a scale of 1 to 10, achieving a mean score of 7.21. Two persons identified the videos as deep-fake generated without pointing out what was fake in the video; they did mention that the traffic was generated."
