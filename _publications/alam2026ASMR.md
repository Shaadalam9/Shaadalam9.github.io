abstract: ASMR videos have become a major genre on online platforms, yet their large-scale characteristics remain underexplored. Using YouTube Data API and a pytubefix workflow, we assemble a dat0aset of 20,087 ASMR videos from 4,076 channels (2008–2025, 40 languages) enriched with duration, views, likes, inferred language, theme flags, and lemmatised title description text. English dominates (82.19% of videos), followed by Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese. Across the corpus, the mean growth is 2,146.25 views per day and the duration analysis shows that short videos (<10 minutes) average 4,128.62 views per day versus 1,225.65 for 10 to 30 minute content, while very long (>180 minutes) videos reach 5,228.64 views per day. Theme detection indicates that sleep-related (17.79%) and visual-trigger content (16.30%) are particularly prevalent, with whisper (11.49%) and binaural videos (10.29\%) also common, while driving-themed videos remain rare (9.84%). K-means clustering on multimodal text, language, and engagement features, visualised with t-SNE, yields 11 content clusters (9–7,300 videos) and a small set of extremely high-growth videos.
