abstract: "As vehicles with SAE level 2 automation become increasingly prevalent in certain countries and are set to expand globally, understanding the behaviour of pedestrians and other road users in these evolving scenarios is essential. This study investigates how the presence of an automated vehicle equipped with an external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) or a manually driven car influences pedestrians' crossing decision-making processes as the distance between them varies. We examine the conditions under which vehicles yield, offering a comprehensive perspective on pedestrian-vehicle interactions in dynamic environments. Using a virtual reality (VR) experiment, we manipulate several key variables: the distance between two pedestrians, whether the incoming vehicle yields, the presence of an eHMI, and the pedestrian's standing position relative to the second person. Both pedestrians aim to cross the road, and we observe how these factors impact one pedestrian's decision-making process in the presence of another."
