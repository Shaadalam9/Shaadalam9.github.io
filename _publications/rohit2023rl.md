abstract: "A majority of marine accidents that occur can be attributed to errors in human decisions. Through automation, the occurrence of such incidents can be minimized. Therefore, automation in the marine industry has been receiving increased attention in the recent years. This paper investigates the automation of the path following action of a ship. A deep Q-learning approach is proposed to solve the path-following problem of a ship. This method comes under the broader area of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and is well suited for such tasks, as it can learn to take optimal decisions through sufficient experience. This algorithm also balances the exploration and the exploitation schemes of an agent operating in an environment. A three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) dynamic model is adopted to describe the shipâ€™s motion. The Krisco container ship (KCS) is chosen for this study as it is a benchmark hull that is used in several studies and its hydrodynamic coefficients are readily available for numerical modeling. Numerical simulations for the turning circle and zig-zag maneuver tests are performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed dynamic model. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent is trained to interact with this numerical model to achieve waypoint tracking. Finally, the proposed approach is investigated not only by numerical simulations but also by model experiments using 1:75.5 scaled model."
