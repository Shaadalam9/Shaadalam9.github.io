abstract: "Recent advancements in GAN-based architectures have led to innovative methods for image transformation. The lack of diverse environmental data, such as different lighting conditions and seasons in public data, prevents the researchers from effectively comparing the difference in driver and road user behaviour. This study introduces a deep learning pipeline combining CycleGAN-turbo and Real-ESRGAN to enhance traffic scene video transformations. Evaluated using dashcam videos from London, HongKong, and Los Angeles, our pipeline shows a 7.97% improvement in T-SIMM for temporal consistency compared to CycleGAN-turbo for night-to-day transformation for HongKong. PSNR and VPQ scores are comparable, but the pipeline outperforms in DINO structure similarity and KL divergence, with up to 155.47% better structural fidelity in HongKong. This approach demonstrates superior realism and temporal coherence in day-to-night, night-to-day and clear-to-rainy transitions."
