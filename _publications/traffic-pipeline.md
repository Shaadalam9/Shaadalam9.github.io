abstract: "Recent advances in GAN-based architectures have led to innovative methods for image transformation. The lack of diverse environmental data, such as different lighting conditions and seasons in public data, prevents researchers from effectively studying the difference in driver and road user behaviour under varying conditions. This study introduces a deep learning pipeline that combines CycleGAN-turbo and Real-ESRGAN to improve video transformations of the traffic scene. Evaluated using dashcam videos from London, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles, our pipeline shows a 7.97% improvement in T-SIMM for temporal consistency compared to CycleGAN-turbo for night-today transformation for Hong Kong. PSNR and VPQ scores are comparable, but the pipeline performs better in DINO structure similarity and KL divergence, with up to 153.49% better structural fidelity in Hong Kong compared to Pix2Pix and 107.32% better compared to ToDayGAN. This approach demonstrates better realism and temporal coherence in day-tonight, night-today, and clear-to-rainy transitions."
