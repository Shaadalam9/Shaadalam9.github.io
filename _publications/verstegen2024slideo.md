abstract: "In cities, cycling is an important method of transportation due to being sustainable, healthy and less space-intensive than motorized traffic. Therefore, it should be promoted and made as accessible and pleasurable as possible. Conversely, current developments in automated vehicles (AVs) are threatening to make cycling less pleasurable and accessible. The majority of the existing literature focuses on external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) positioned on AVs to tell cyclists and pedestrians what to do. This requires cyclists to actively look for and interpret this information, and can reduce the ability of the cyclist to make their own decisions. This project aims to allow cyclists to share their intentions with AVs through bicycle-to-vehicle (B2V) communication, resulting in a proposal for a new design concept to allow cyclists to interact with AVs. This paper assumes a specific context for the design to be useful. It assumes that the majority of motorized enclosed vehicles (like cars, trucks, etc.) on the road are automated, and connected to a communication network. The communication within this network is meant to make the traffic flow as efficiently as possible, while also enhancing safety. Through B2V interaction, this project proposes to allow cyclists to be a part of this network too, by using slidable handles to communicate their intention to turn. If AVs are aware that a cyclist is planning to make a turn, they can slow down to give this cyclist enough space to turn, ideally without having to come to a full stop. This can make cycling more enjoyable, comfortable and accessible. Combined with other measures to promote cycling, these can be reasons for commuters to choose to cycle rather than drive, which is beneficial for the environment as well as public health. With a design sprint being the first step after defining the context, the general idea of using a physical motion to communicate the cyclistâ€™s intention was defined. Through a user questionnaire conducted among people with cycling experience, the generally preferred location of this physical interaction was defined. The hands were rated as being the most intuitive, due to having more precise control and the ability to more accurately sense haptic feedback. Through sketching and prototyping, the motion of sliding the handle slightly sideways (like pulling it off of the handlebar) was chosen due to its simplicity, relation to the direction, and the expectation of it not interfering with motions already performed by the hands when cycling. However, the general design concept can also be applied through different interactions and requires future research. After performing a user test about the haptic feedback after indicating a direction, it can be concluded that there is enough potential in the idea of using B2V communication to allow cyclists to participate in the network of vehicles and that it is worth exploring and developing further."
